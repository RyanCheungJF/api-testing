# Express Server with CI Testing

This repository demostrates making a simple REST API with Express and Node. 

Instead of using a database and hosting it online, we use local data stored in a json file which be found under `dummy/users.json`.

Interacting with the `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` commands will change the contents of the file.
